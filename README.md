# Anemia detection with machine learning
---
##Overview
This repo consist of pythom machine leanring code for the detection of the anemi using the data from Kaggle, provided by the username Biswa Ranjan Rao, and the direct URL to the dataset is https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/biswaranjanrao/anemia-dataset.

The dataset consists of 1421 samples with six attributes: gender, hemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), and result.

The result attribute(class), represented by the binary values 0 for non-anemic and 1 for anemic in the data set, was selected as the response variable. The gender attribute being binary, all other attributes were continuous variables, and the memory size consumed by the dataset was 66.7 MB.

## Introduction to Anemia
Anemia is a medical condition characterized by a deficiency of healthy red blood cells in the body or a reduction in the amount of hemoglobin in the blood. Hemoglobin is the protein in red blood cells responsible for carrying oxygen throughout the body. Anemia can occur due to various reasons such as a lack of iron or other essential nutrients, chronic diseases, genetic conditions, blood loss, or a malfunction in the bone marrow.

Symptoms of anemia include fatigue, weakness, shortness of breath, dizziness, pale skin, irregular heartbeat, and headaches. Treatment for anemia depends on the underlying cause, but it may involve dietary changes, supplements, medication, or, in severe cases, blood transfusions.

It is important to identify and treat anemia promptly, as it can lead to complications such as heart problems, impaired cognitive function, and delayed growth and development in children.

Contributions are what make the open source community such an amazing place to learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make are greatly appreciated.






## Objective: 
   - To build up the machine leanring model to classifiy anemic condition
   - To see if gender has an impact on hemoglobin levels   
   - To compare the six different Ml algorithms for best detection
